Here's a more detailed and enhanced description for your GitHub project:

Firewall Configuration Project with 2 PCs, 1 Switch, and 1 Server (Using IP & ICMP Protocols):  
Created a secure network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer consisting of two PCs, a switch, and a server. Configured a firewall using Access Control Lists (ACLs) to filter traffic based on IP addresses and control ICMP (ping) protocol communication between devices. The project demonstrated advanced traffic filtering techniques, allowing only authorized IP addresses to access the server and preventing unauthorized ping requests for enhanced security. Focused on implementing network security best practices and providing controlled communication across the network.
